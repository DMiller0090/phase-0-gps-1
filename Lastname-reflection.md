1. I was struggling with knowing when to make a branch and when to merge a branch
2. Lorena helped me understand when to merge and how to deal with conflicts
3. I asked Lorena with syntax help with git and markdown, also with merging requests on Github
4. Since in this GPS my pair wasn't able to be there, I wasn't able to have a collaborator to my repository, so I'm not sure what to expect when I do.
5. I enjoyed my experience with Lorena, she was patient and helpful. It was unfortunate that my pair wasn't able to make it but overall it was a great experience.
